Sunny
Sunny, thank you for the smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for the gleam that shows its grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
The dark days are gone
And the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you
I love you (you're my baby)
I love you (Sunny)
I love you
I love you (Sunny)
